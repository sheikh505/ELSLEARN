        <p>Starting  with  the  O  and  A  Level  courses,  ELS  facilitates  students  to  test  their  skills in  a  variety  of  manners;  i.e. students can attempt tests topic by topic, they can limit the number of questions, they can set the difficulty level of questions, they can even set the time duration allowed to attempt a complete test, or they can simply attempt a real exam from the past papers. This rigorous testing technique allows students to make their preparations under various pressurized circumstances. Not only simple MCQs are used to test the students, but ‘Fill in the Blanks’, ‘True/False’ and Descriptive/Structured Questions are also being incorporated in order to assess the true knowledge of students.</p>

        <p>ELS tends to  ease the  most bugging problem faced by teachers these  days; i.e. Students’ Assessment. Teachers can now signup at ELS and access the biggest pool of questions available online. Teachers can also create their own questions and upload them in the ELS database; hence, they can develop their exams by using their own questions, questions entered by other teachers and questions already available in the ELS vast database. Every time a teacher develops an exam, a CODE is generated by the system. This simple code can be used by the students to access that particular  exam  easily.  Teachers  will  get  the  results  instantly  once  their  students  attempt  the  exams.  Records  of results and exams are easily stored with the teachers for use in future as well.  </p>

        <h2>Schools</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>ELS is also offering schools to get their separate portals over the website. This way, schools can easily get all their students engaged in a synchronized testing system. ELS is not only used for taking examinations, but it can also be used  for  day-to-day  course  preparations.  Schools  can  get  their  students  to  attempt  questions  by  setting  various parameters; i.e. topic, difficulty level, time allowed, etc. Attempts and their results are stored, and schools can keep a  continuous  eye  over  the  performance  of  all  their students  very  easily.  Different  charts  and  stats  will  allow  the school  to  assess  the  overall  educational  behaviour of  students.  Furthermore,  besides  the  standardized testing means, many other types of assessments can also be developed for any particular school with its collaboration.</p>
